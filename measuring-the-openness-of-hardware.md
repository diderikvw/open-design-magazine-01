# Jérémy Bonvoisin - Measuring the openness of hardware

## Outline

What makes a hardware product “open source”? To date there is no generally acknowledged answer to this question. This leaves large room for interpretation in the usage of the term “open source hardware”. In order to support the public debate on this issue, we created the open-o-meter, a simple scale allowing measuring the openness of a hardware product. With this scale, we checked the openness of 132 open source hardware development projects. We also identified that hardware development projects may go open source for two main different reasons: either to encourage contribution from external people or to make their product replicable. It also appeared that a significant number of projects label their product “open source” without sharing substantial information, indicating a clear misuse of the term. Our results confirm there is some kind of confusion about what makes a product or a project open source. This highlights a need to set standards in order to achieve clarity in the field of open source hardware.

### Author information

Jérémy Bonvoisin is an expert of sustainable product design. Following resolute ecological convictions, he focuses on open source as a way to enable sustainable production and consumption patterns. He works towards setting standards for open source hardware and performs research about citizen participation in product development and production processes. Along the precedent years of research, he dealt with topics like remanufacturing, energy efficiency of electric and electronic products and environmental assessment of ICT-based services. He is assistant professor at the Department of Mechanical engineering, University of Bath, England.

## Interview

### What would you like to know more about?

Diderik would like to know more about:

1. Jérémy's personal motivation and passion for Open Source Design, his reasons for spending part of his life on this initiative, his values and personal journey that led him here.
2. What OPEN! is about, in a brief summary of a few sentences 
3. What has been done far and what is to come in OPEN!
4. The top 3 key insights resulting from OPEN!, for acedemia, but also for practitioners of Open Source Design \(if any\).
5. What "open source hardware" means from the OPEN! perspective and why the Open-o-meter was contructed and applied.
6. Key insights from applying the Open-o-meter, both qualitative and quantitative; both academic and practical \(if any\).
7. If there is any further application of the Open-o-meter and if any: in academia, or outside, or both, and what the value/ambition could be.
