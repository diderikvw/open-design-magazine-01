What does it look like when a group of Danish manufacturing companies, backed by the Danish government, starts to open source physical products in order to grow their business? Companies ranging from startups like outdoor furniture manufacturer Out-sider or urban gardening systems company TagTomat to medium sized companies like 100-year old industrial drill bit manufacturer Thürmer Tools – all the way up to the world’s largest water pump manufacturer, Grundfos and global enzyme and biochemical product mastodon Novozymes. Through a design-driven business development programme, REMODEL, these companies and several others have been using design methods to build new open source-based business strategies and business models during the spring of 2018 and the facilitator, Danish Design Centre, hereby share what came out of this effort.
