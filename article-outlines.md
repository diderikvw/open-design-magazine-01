## Jérémy Bonvoisin - Measuring the openness of hardware

### Outline

What makes a hardware product “open source”? To date there is no generally acknowledged answer to this question. This leaves large room for interpretation in the usage of the term “open source hardware”. In order to support the public debate on this issue, we created the open-o-meter, a simple scale allowing measuring the openness of a hardware product. With this scale, we checked the openness of 132 open source hardware development projects. We also identified that hardware development projects may go open source for two main different reasons: either to encourage contribution from external people or to make their product replicable. It also appeared that a significant number of projects label their product “open source” without sharing substantial information, indicating a clear misuse of the term. Our results confirm there is some kind of confusion about what makes a product or a project open source. This highlights a need to set standards in order to achieve clarity in the field of open source hardware.

### Author information

Jérémy Bonvoisin is an expert of sustainable product design. Following resolute ecological convictions, he focuses on open source as a way to enable sustainable production and consumption patterns. He works towards setting standards for open source hardware and performs research about citizen participation in product development and production processes. Along the precedent years of research, he dealt with topics like remanufacturing, energy efficiency of electric and electronic products and environmental assessment of ICT-based services. He is assistant professor at the Department of Mechanical engineering, University of Bath, England.

What does it look like when a group of Danish manufacturing companies, backed by the Danish government, starts to open source physical products in order to grow their business? Companies ranging from startups like outdoor furniture manufacturer Out-sider or urban gardening systems company TagTomat to medium sized companies like 100-year old industrial drill bit manufacturer Thürmer Tools – all the way up to the world’s largest water pump manufacturer, Grundfos and global enzyme and biochemical product mastodon Novozymes. Through a design-driven business development programme, REMODEL, these companies and several others have been using design methods to build new open source-based business strategies and business models during the spring of 2018 and the facilitator, Danish Design Centre, hereby share what came out of this effort.

## Emilio Velis and Frederick van Amstel - Corais: Platform design experience for open communities in Brazil
Open Design was born as an analogue to Open Source Software, a concept that advocates for attaching software source code as part of an official product release. The analogy went by stating that electronic drawings and models be released together with physical products, in the hopes of enabling modifications or self-production through digital fabrication. Nowadays, the development of design as a discipline that goes beyond sharing schematics, a procedure, or even source code, has shifted the focus of open design into a more complex activity, pushing it to the forefront of peer production, shared commons, critical making, and participatory design.

The nature of open communities usually brings organic problems to their organization and processes. These problem grow even bigger when teams collaborate remotely, detached from the same experience of collaboration and feedback that locals teams have. Furthermore, although open communities stress on the importance of documentation for the functioning of projects, this is often seen as "(...) highly valued, frequently overlooked, and a means for establishing inclusive and accessible communities." [^1]

In 2014, Fred and a few of his colleagues developed Corais [^2] as an open design experiment local projects in Brazil, under the idea that platforms may help project managers shape the experience of their users as they design, or in in the words of Andries Van Onck[^3], to aim for "a system that favors project development". In more recent years, the parallel idea that "Code is Law", by Lawrence Lessig, has taught us about the importance of designing good platforms for open design communities in a way that they can obtain open, well-documented processes and products.
The initial aim of the platform was to support Open Design projects in Brazil, yet the Brazilian design community did not make use of it. Instead, cultural producers, activists and teachers populated the platform with collaborative projects such as hackerspaces, cultural events, web ontologies, visual identities, and so on. Whenever the platform failed to support their variegated design activities, they manifested their issues in the platform forum and proposed alternatives for its development. Other channels were also used to engage with the platform's metadesign.
Corais functions under the following characteristics:

1. The ability to customize the user experience depending on the type of project: by adding from a set of tools
2. The use and enforcing of open licenses.
3. Abstraction through documentation
4. The emergence of definite elements that can be deconstructed and reconfigured, depending on the needs of each project. This ability allows to contain different levels of granularity, as projects can exist as a minimal unit which can be merged into bigger projects.

An analysis of the community interaction reveals that there is production of freedom in metadesign activity. People are not just using the documents, methods, processes, and tools offered by the platform, but they are also constantly modifying them. In fact, a new version of the platform is currently being developed by a group of cultural producers. This account is based on the public data left from community interaction held at the platform. An analysis of these accounts in light of the metadesign principles stated by Caio Vassão (abstraction, diagram, procedure and emergence) suggests a consciouss effort of the platform communities to understand and shape metadesign activity.

This finding have serious implications for Open Design. The case study confirms that sharing source code is not enough to enable design freedom. However, it challenges the accepted notion that participation in design produces freedom. The evidence suggests that freedom in design can only be attained when people not just participate, but understand and master the production of documents, processes, methods, and tools of design, in short, when they produce their own metadesign freedom.
